"""
Step 1: Fetch model outputs from https://github.com/evalplus/repoqa/releases/tag/dev-results
Step 2: Evaluate these outputs to some high-level metrics (multiple json files)
Step 3: Summarize these metrics into a single json file for each context size config to simplify the leaderboard plotting

NOTE: Only keep the final json files and ignore other intermediate files to make the repo minimal
